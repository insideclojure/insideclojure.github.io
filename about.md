I work on maintaining Clojure with Rich Hickey, Stuart Halloway, and all the other fine 
Clojurists at [Cognitect](http://cognitect.com). A lot of what I do day to day involves
reviewing incoming tickets and patches for Clojure or working on new features or
enhancements. 

Most of this work involves deeply understanding the code base for Clojure itself and I
created this blog to record my own thoughts, both for my own memories and because
this might be of use to others wishing to understand how Clojure works from the inside.

Disclaimer: Any thoughts or opinions expressed in this blog are mine, not official
statements by Cognitect about Clojure.
