## Spec	schema and select

I spent the bulk of the week this week focused on implementing schema support and modifying s/select in spec-alpha2. Rather than leave long-winded stuff here, I tried to summarize in more doc form here:

* [Schema-and-select](https://github.com/clojure/spec-alpha2/wiki/Schema-and-select)

There are still various parts of this that I'm working on, and some issues to work through, so still a work in progress.

It's been a busy week, so keeping this one short!
