## Spec	schema and select

This week was spent on some additional updates to the schema/select stuff from last week. The [schema and select](https://github.com/clojure/spec-alpha2/wiki/Schema-and-select) mini guide has been updated along with the changes.

Here's a list of modifications since last week:

* Schemas are now spec objects, and not a different kind of thing
* Schemas with unqualified keys work with nested schemas (see examples in guide)
* Schemas cannot contain selects - this is a form of "closed" that we're looking to avoid
* Selection pattern is now required - this was previously optional but that case is really covered by schema now

We've also been doing some design work on a couple other aspects of schemas and select which hopefully will be ready to talk about in the next journal.

### Other stuff I enjoyed this week...

We got the whole Cognitect gang together in Durham last week and it was great to actually spend some time with all the people I usually just see virtually. I had a great time and hope to see them again soon!

I played a round of [Dead of Winter](https://www.plaidhatgames.com/games/dead-of-winter) with some of the gang. Things looked bleak for a while but we did accomplish our main objective by making some terrible sacrifices! Fun game - first time I'd played.
