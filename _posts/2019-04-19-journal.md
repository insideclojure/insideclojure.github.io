## Closed spec checking

As I mentioned last week, I've been working on adding a new form of closed spec checking and that's in master for spec 2 now, or at least the first cut of it. The idea is that you can mark one or more (or all) specs as "closed" and they will then act in that mode for `valid?`, `conform`, and `explain` until you open them again. The specs themselves are unaltered - there is no marker in the symbolic spec form indicating "closed"-ness, rather this is a checking mode that you can turn on, kind of like `instrument`.

{% highlight clojure %}
(require '[clojure.spec-alpha2 :as s])
(s/def ::f string?)
(s/def ::l string?)
(s/def ::s (s/schema [::f ::l]))
(s/valid? ::s {::x 10})  ;; "extra" keys are ok
;;=> true

;; now "close" the ::s spec (no-arg arity closes all specs)
(s/close-specs ::s)
(s/valid? ::s {::x 10})
;;=> false

(s/explain ::s {::x 10})
;; #:user{:x 10} - failed: (subset? #{:user/f :user/l} (set (keys %))) spec: :user/s

;; now open again
(s/open-specs ::s)

(s/valid? ::s {::x 10})
;;=> true
{% endhighlight %}

Still a lot of open questions about the API, behavior, etc, but this should give you an idea.

## Clojure 1.10.1

We had some good feedback at the beginning of the week on Clojure 1.10.1-beta2, particularly about the error reporting aspects which go to a file. I continue to think that the default of writing to a temp file is best, but grew unsatisfied with the configurability of what was there, which was only a new clojure.main option. Instead of having a flag, decided it should be an enumeration of options - file (for temp file), stderr, and none. Also, having it just as a flag on clojure.main meant that every external launcher didn't know how to do that, whereas making it a Java system property is already a configurable path that these tools (like Leiningen) can already handle. So, I made it check Java system property, then optionally override from clojure.main flag, and default to file mode. This is all captured in [CLJ-2504](https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-2504) which I expect will go through screening next week.

I'm also growing a little concerned at the number of people patching around [CLJ-1472](https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1472) for Graal so will probably discuss that with Rich and consider whether to do anything for 1.10.1. The proposalss are tricky and may have unexpected perf impacts so its a difficult one to assess.

In any case, we would like to bring this release to an RC soon and get it released.

Rich has a couple api additions he put together this week related to metadata retention and those will get slotted in once we're looking at 1.11 again.

## Other stuff I enjoyed this week...

I haven't had many music recommendations lately as I went through a bit of a dry spell. But I listened to a lot of music this week! My son is a drummer and has been doing an Aretha Franklin / Stevie Wonder show recently so it's been a lot of fun watching him listen to a lot of stuff I've loved for a long time but that's new to him. So many great tracks on Songs in the Key of Life, but he's particularly digging on [Sir Duke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sIjSNTS7Fs) and the oddball [Contusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2S6Kjqi5vk) this week.

In newer music, I really dug [Lay Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfGmHitLYl8) by CLAVVS (pronounced "claws"), that's from a 3-song EP and I like all 3 tunes on that.

I also want to give a shout-out to Stuart Sierra's new podcast [No Manifestos](https://www.nomanifestos.com/) - the first 3 episdodes were all great! I really enjoyed listening to them.

Also, outside the Clojure world I run this little conference called [Strange Loop](https://thestrangeloop.com) - the [CFP is open now](https://thestrangeloop.com/cfp.html), please submit!
