## Clojure 1.10.1-beta3

We released Clojure 1.10.1-beta3 this week - please give it a whirl. The only change in it is [CLJ-2504](https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-2504) 
which redoes the clojure.main changes to support different error reporting targets. The most important part of that is that you can specify the target via either a clojure.main option or by a Java system property. The latter is useful because you can take control via existing Java system property support in Leiningen or other tools without needing any subsequent changes in Leiningen.

Specifically, the default behavior for error reporting with Clojure 1.10.1-beta3 is to write the error report and stack trace to a file, but you can also change that to stderr via system property `-Dclojure.main.report=stderr` if you prefer.

This change was made in response to feedback on Clojure 1.10.1-beta2, so thanks! We plan to move pretty directly from here towards an RC and release, so give it a try.

## JIRA migration

I have spent a fair bit of time this week migrating our [aging JIRA system](https://dev.clojure.org/jira) to a [new cloud hosted instance](https://clojure.atlassian.net). That migration is now largely complete from a data perspective - users, projects, issues, attachments, etc have all been migrated. I am still working on many of the finer details (important reports, permission schemes, screen setups) and new processes for filing issues (won't require an account) and becoming a contributor. Thanks for your patience, it's been a slog but this will be a big help moving forward.

## Other stuff I enjoyed this week...

I was very fortunate in the past week to see two bands that I love for the first time. First, I took a jaunt out to Denver to catch Vulfpeck at Red Rocks. It was cold and a bit snowy, but it was a fantastic show, including a bonus set from the Vulfpeck spinoff Fearless Flyers! I really enjoyed the opening set from [Cory Henry](https://www.coryhenrymusic.com/) - funk organ trio and his guesting during Vulfpeck's set. There were so many great songs in the show but probably the high point for me was [Wait for the Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_x6Igq6axY) featuring Antwaun Stanley on vocals and Cory Henry guesting on organ. Beautiful, amazing version.

And then this week I got to see Tool back home in [St. Louis](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/tool/2019/enterprise-center-st-louis-mo-7390d251.html). Great show and enjoyed seeing a couple new tunes from their (finally) upcoming album - end of August it looks like. Both new songs were predominantly in 7 and they had a large 7-pointed star in the set, so maybe a theme. My favorite album is Lateralus so I probably enjoyed Parabola and Schism the most.
